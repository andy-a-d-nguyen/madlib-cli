Make Me A Video Game!

I the good and fresh John have went Stacy's red sister and plan to steal her blue cars!

What are a elephant and backpacking rat to do? Before you can help Mary, you'll have to collect the rough buses and smooth clouds that open up the 20 worlds connected to A Donald's Lair. There are 54 cities and 74 molasses in the game, along with hundreds of other goodies for you to find.
